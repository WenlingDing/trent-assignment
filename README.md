Intro
---
My project is to imagine myself as tour plan agency of my hometown, Wuhan in China. As the product is on tourism on Wuhan, the main goal is to provide the good plans for the potential customers. Photos are the key driver of the content with commentary of each photo to provide information to prospective tourists the beauty of Wuhan and the packages the tour agency offers along with a contact information.

I want to provide the capabilities to design a website according to the nature of the product via a user friendly approach. I want to show that I understand the importance of design and the coding skills I have to implement the design I envision.

Future enhancements
---
At the point of the project, I was not taught javascript and database. However, I envision with the skills I was taught in later classes of the course, I could add functions in buttons so that them can work.

Testing
---
The website navigation is clear and provide the optimal information for people looking to have a holiday in Wuhan and how to contact the tour agency to book or for further information.

I tested the HTML and CSS By Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that it displays correctly at all screen sizes.
